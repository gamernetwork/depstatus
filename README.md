# depstatus

Iterates over your dependencies, tries to figure out what branch they're on, and tells you if you have uncommitted changes.

Works with Git and Subversion repos.

## Installation

Check out and symbolically link into `$project/bin`, or copy it, or whatever, I'm not precious.

Edit to configure where to look for libs (defaults to `./lib`).
